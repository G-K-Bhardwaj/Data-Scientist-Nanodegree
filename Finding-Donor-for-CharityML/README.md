# Finding Donor for CharityML

This is the first project of the Data Scientist Nanodegree. In this project we will find the supervised learning technique and Analytical mind on the data collected for the US census for a CharityML.

CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. 
Here our objective is to build an algorithm to best identify potential donors. In the process we will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation.

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

* Python
* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn (v0.17)
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook
